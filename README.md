## Hi there 👋

Web Developer since 2014. Working with Typescript, Vue/Nuxt and Azure on a daily basis since 2022.

🔭 Currently I am working on multiple personal web apps. The most important ones to me are [plantz](https://github.com/DenFin/plantz.app) which helps me to keep track of my – you guessed it – plants. The other one is invoi which helps me to generate beautiful invoice PDFs. 

🌱 In my homelab, I experiment with technologies like Linux and Docker. I general I want to get more into system design.

🔄 This profile is still work in progress.
